                    <p>I am an aspiring software/web developer currently learning HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I am familiarizing myself with the basics of data structures and algorithms. I will use this website to keep me motivated to learn and track my progress as I grow. In the future, I plan to also learn Javascript, Java, and C++.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Background</h3>
                    <p>I graduated from NYU with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, but realized in the last year of my degree that I was more passionate about computer science and coding. Unfortunate timing, I know. But with NYU's tuition being what it is, I decided to finish my degree and learn to code on my own.<br><br>During my time in school, I took two introductory programming classes—one in MATLAB and one in Python—and designed some software for my senior design course, so I have a very basic baseline in coding.<br><br>As of now, I am based in sunny southern California. In addition to learning to code, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, reading, and using the things I learned during my actual degree to make things.
