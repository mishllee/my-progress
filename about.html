            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I graduated from NYU with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, but realized in the last year of my degree that I was more passionate about computer science and coding. Unfortunate timing, I know. But with NYU's tuition being what it is, I decided to finish my degree and learn to code on my own.<br><br>During that time, I took two introductory programming classes and designed some software for my senior design course.<br><br>As of now, I am based in sunny southern California. In addition to learning to code, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, reading, and using the things I learned during my actual degree to <a href="./projects.html">make things</a>.</p>
