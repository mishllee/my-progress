            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>I am an aspiring software/web developer currently learning HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I am familiarizing myself with the basics of data structures and algorithms. I will use this website to keep me motivated to learn and track my progress as I grow. In the future, I plan to also learn Javascript, Java, and C++.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I graduated from NYU with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, but realized in the last year of my degree that I was more passionate about computer science and coding. Unfortunate timing, I know. But with NYU's tuition being what it is, I decided to finish my degree and learn to code on my own.<br><br>During my time in school, I took two introductory programming classes, one in MATLAB and one in Python, and designed some software for my senior design course.<br><br>As of now, I am based in sunny southern California. In addition to learning to code, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, reading, and using the things I learned during my actual degree to <a href="./projects.html">make things</a>.</p>
